The pps package consists of several functions for selecting a sample from a
finite population. Some possible uses of the package are mentioned in the
User's Guide, pps-ug.pdf. The package implements mainly
probability-proportional-to-size (PPS) methods, specifically PPS systematic
sampling and Sampford's method.  Details are given in the User's Guide. It is
assumed that the user has some familiarity with sample survey theory and
methods.

The software should be considered beta software. Any improvements are welcome;
my e-mail address is jack.gambino@gmail.com. Development and testing have
been done largely on a linux system. I would be interested in hearing of
experiences on other platforms.

The methods implemented in the package are well known and I deserve no credit 
whatsoever for them. This package is just my (very) little contribution to the
free software movement, from which I have benefited enormously.

The legal mumbo-jumbo follows.
